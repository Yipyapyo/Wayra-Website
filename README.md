Project brief
This section provides a summary of what the project aims to produce, explained in the client's own words.

We manage a large portfolio of startups and scaleups. They share a great deal of information with us in a variety of different formats. Much of that knowledge is communicated person to person. Our objective is essentially to draw that information together, to categorise and delineate it and make it accessible by anybody in the business intuitively. We would then like to use that information to draw relationships between our portfolio, their founders, investors and advisors and our customers both within Telefónica and externally. We would like the system to update itself using external databases such as Crunchbase, F6S, AngelList etc with each company's current and former investors, for example, and perhaps key clients. We can then use this database to find out about how our portfolio companies, founders, investors, advisors, customers and Telefónica all co-relate and from that, start to build workflows to automate certain processes, such as the approval of documents using tools like DocuSign.

Feature set ideas
This section provides a some ideas about the feature set of the project, as shared by the client. It is important to note that this does not replace requirements engineering. If you have questions about the project requirements, they will be worked out during the project.

See above - some kind of external automatic updating and verification using databases like Crunchbase would be useful. We would also like to build the database into a wider management tool using over applications that we use, such as Pipedrive, Asana, Teams, DocuSign, etc.

Flexibility of scope
This section explains how rigid/flexible the scope of the project is, as explained by the client.

I have a clear vision for the software, but I am unsure how to communicate that to the students.    I expect the students to collaborate with me to elicit the software requirement
